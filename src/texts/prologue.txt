 The last few months were the hardest you've ever known. Or was it weeks?
 Years maybe? When you're trying to survive in the broken wasteland that was
 once civilization, time means very little, if anything; you've practically
 lost all sense of it. You've lost sense of a great many things. The lines
 between reality and delirium themselves begin to thin as the days go by.
 You can hardly even remember your name, who you are or how it is that you are
 still alive.
 Sometimes, in your more coherent moments, you wonder if the corruption had
 touched you as well, if you too will soon turn into one of those mindless
 monstrosities that roam the cracked uneven earth - but hardly any part of you
 is left to care anymore.




















 And now, the tower... the tower...
 The tower, the last tower, the only building still left standing. How was it
 left untouched? why hasn't it fallen like the others? destroyed by horrible
 beasts? Those questions flickered like short lived fireflies in your mind as 
 you made way towards it. It didn't matter, none of it mattered.
 You knew, ever since the first time you laid your eyes on that darkened
 skyscraper from afar, you knew you had to get there, you knew you had to climb
 it. You didn't know why, You just knew you had to. To a sick dying man in a
 sick dying world, this became an obsession. You HAD to get to the top of that
 tower... there was nothing else left to live for, no other purpose to your
 existence now.






















 Standing in front of the heavy sealed magnetic doors, you notice a small
 access hatch you could maybe squeeze through. You know you're entering the
 mouth of the beast. You heard the screams emanating from this building miles
 away - but even if it means wading through hell itself, you will make it up
 there - or die trying.
