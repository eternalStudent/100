What is 100? (or: what the crap am I playing?):
 
100 is a very light-weight roguelike, wherein your objective is to make it to
the top of a one-hundred story building, facing increasingly tougher
opposition. The game uses a simple ASCII interface and relatively few commands.
There are no NPCs, no shops and no side branches, making this very much a
'Coffeebreak Roguelike'.


 
 
Game Overview (or: what the crap is going on?):

This is you: @
In most levels, your mission is to make it to the staircase (represented by >)
and reach the next level. Pretty much everything else in the game is trying to
kill you.
Enemies are represented by letters, other characters can be weapons, grenades
or other items you will drastically need to survive. If you are unsure about a
character on the screen, use the (l)ook command to determine what it is.
Except for a few, every level will have a variety of enemies that will stand in
your way. They range from the simple Zeds, humanoid zombie-like shamblers, to
robotic defense drones - and they all have one thing in common: they don't like
you. You don't have to kill every enemy in a given level to proceed, but
skipping too many might not be a good idea.
Enemies have different abilities, strengths and weaknesses to consider.
